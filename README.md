# Overview
The repository is intended to hold the progress of the project related to the Real-Time Graphics Programming course at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.

# Info
The goal of this project is to create an interactive real-time 3D Aim Trainer. In this kind of application the player has to aim and shoot to a set of static or moving targets. This project is also intended to show different graphical effects and light-material interactions exploiting OpenGL low-level functions.

# Requirements
The following files are required to make the application work, but have not been included in the github respository due to the large file size.
These files need to be put inside a "libs" folder.
* assimp-vc142-mt.lib
* Bullet3Common.lib
* BulletCollision.lib
* BulletDynamics.lib
* freetype.lib
* glfw3.lib
* IrrXML.lib
* LinearMath.lib
* minizip.lib
* zlib.lib
